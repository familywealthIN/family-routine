# Goal Creation Autosave Feature Test

## Features Implemented

### 1. GraphQL Mutation

* ✅ Added `autosaveGoalContribution` mutation in `src/server/resolvers/goal.js`
* ✅ Updates only the `contribution` field for performance
* ✅ Requires `id`,  `date`,  `period`, and `contribution` parameters

### 2. Frontend Autosave Functionality

* ✅ Added autosave data properties in `GoalCreation.vue`:
  + `autosaveTimeout`: Manages debounced saving
  + `autosaveDelay`: 2-second delay for better UX
  + `isAutosaving`: Loading state indicator
  + `lastSavedContribution`: Tracks changes
  + `lastAutosaveSuccess`: Success state indicator

### 3. Methods Added

* ✅ `scheduleAutosave()`: Debounces autosave calls
* ✅ `autosaveContribution()`: Performs the GraphQL mutation
* ✅ Cleanup in `beforeDestroy()` hook

### 4. Watchers

* ✅ `newGoalItem.contribution`: Triggers autosave when content changes
* ✅ Updated `newGoalItem` watcher to initialize last saved value

### 5. Visual Indicators

* ✅ "Saving..." chip when autosave is in progress (orange)
* ✅ "Saved" chip when autosave succeeds (green)
* ✅ Positioned at bottom-right of the editor area
* ✅ Auto-hides after 1.5 seconds

### 6. Performance Optimizations

* ✅ Only autosaves for existing goal items (with ID)
* ✅ Skips autosave if content hasn't actually changed
* ✅ 2-second debounce to prevent excessive API calls
* ✅ Lightweight mutation that updates only contribution field

## Testing Steps

1. **Create a new goal item:**
   - Add title and save the goal
   - Verify it gets an ID and becomes editable

2. **Test autosave functionality:**
   - Start typing in the Description (EasyMDE) field
   - Wait 2 seconds after stopping
   - Should see "Saving..." indicator
   - Should see "Saved" indicator after success

3. **Test debouncing:**
   - Type continuously in the description
   - Verify autosave doesn't trigger during continuous typing
   - Only triggers after 2 seconds of inactivity

4. **Test error handling:**
   - Check browser console for any errors
   - Verify graceful handling of network issues

## Integration Points

* **Backend**: New GraphQL mutation in goal resolvers
* **Frontend**: Enhanced GoalCreation component with autosave
* **Database**: Updates goal item contribution field efficiently
* **UX**: Subtle visual feedback without being intrusive

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: No loss of work when typing long descriptions
2. **Performance**: Efficient updates of only the changed field
3. **Reliability**: Debounced saves prevent server overload
4. **Feedback**: Clear visual indication of save status
5. **Non-intrusive**: Works automatically in the background
