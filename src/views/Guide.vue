        <p>Routine Notes helps you organize your routine and goals.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Groom your routine with Discipline</li>
          <li>Measure your actions with Kinetics</li>
          <li>Achieve your goals with Geniuses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The point system is designed to enable a metric for your evolution in
          three major aspects. These points help you to keep track of your
          ability and enable you to live every day to your full potential. Life
          provided to us would be best utilized if we know how efficiently we
          are contributing to our purpose.
        </p>
        <h2 id="unanimous-points-distribution">
          Unanimous Points Distribution
        </h2>
        <p>
          The point distribution can be set on the routine settings page. The
          maximum number of points in a day is 100 for each sector. In total
          there are 3 sectors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discipline</li>
          <li>Kinetics</li>
          <li>Geniuses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These points are equally divided into routine items. Let&#39;s say,
          you have allocated 30 points to a routine item that lasts for 8 hours.
          The points allocated to 30, 30, 30 to Discipline, Kinetics and
          Geniuses respectively.
        </p>
        <h2 id="base-concept">Base Concept</h2>
        <p>
          To better explain the app functionality let&#39;s take an example of a
          soldier who would like to conquer a mountain captured by enemies.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Discipline</strong>: To capture and conquer something the
              soldier needs to be present there. Therefore, he needs the
              discipline to be there on time. Once he has arrived as routined,
              he will check the routine item checkbox on the home page to gain
              the discipline point.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Kinetics</strong>: Just showing up for something is not
              enough. A soldier has to input daily effort to practice in
              shooting and dodging the enemy fire. This activity can be
              registered as a daily task after he shows up for a daily routine
              item. Logging and observing the task activity will help to track
              and improve the efficiency of the activity that the soldier
              performed. Based on the time interval during the day, the soldier
              will be awarded the Kinetics points for checking each task.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Geniuses</strong>: Now being a single entity at a lower
              rank would not be enough to achieve the goal of conquering the
              mountain. He needs smaller goals that ultimately upranks him to a
              position from where he can make strategic decisions. This is where
              geniuses&#39; points come into the picture. This soldier needs to
              plan weekly, monthly and yearly goals to be in a position to roll
              out his plan and conquer the mountain. All the task that he
              performs on daily basis needs to be linked up as a milestone
              towards your ultimate goals.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Therefore such bifurcation allows anyone to do systematic planning for
          their goals and targets.
        </p>

          Details of Evolutionary Aspects
        </h2>
        <p>
          So let&#39;s say you set a morning 10 AM schedule for your Work
          routine item for 8 hours with a priority of 30 points. Let&#39;s
          consider this for a detailed understanding of each aspect of the
          application.
        </p>
        <h3 id="discipline">Discipline</h3>
        <p>
          It is the principle of behaving and evolving in an environment, the
          way you are supposed to. Discipline in daily routine is gained by
          building and adhering to fixed progressive routine items to achieve
          maximum efficiency during the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app has a routine item checkbox for discipline items. When you
          tick it on time, then you would gain 30 points for discipline.
        </p>
        <h4 id="rules">Rules</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each routine Item has a 1 hour 30 mins slot. The routine item gets
            available before an hour and closes after 30 mins of your routine
            item. If you don&#39;t tick it on time, you won&#39;t be able to
            tick it after 30 mins have passed. It enables you to be more
            punctual considering that you are honest to yourself and don&#39;t
            just tick it and procrastinate later.
          </li>
          <li>
            improve routine efficiency and get Discipline points as the priority
            defined by routine setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            once checked you are committed, hence cannot fall back and uncheck
            because as you know a discipline once established cannot be undone
            easily.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="points-system">Points System</h4>
        <p>
          Entire Routine Points are awarded, the moment the checkbox is checked.
        </p>
        <h3 id="kinetics">Kinetics</h3>
        <p>
          Kinetics works on a bi-hourly basis with daily goals or activities. It
          means that you have to perform 1 task every 2 hours. If your task
          activity is too long, segregate it into smaller parts. In this way,
          you would get a pause to rethink the strategy to complete a task in a
          given routine time. Hence for 8 hours routine task, you have to
          perform 4 activity items. Each item will have a divided point i.e 7.5
          and once marks as complete, the points will be awarded to the kinetics
          of the routine item.
        </p>
        <h4 id="rules">Rules</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            2-hour slot for a single task. Keeping a task deadline and
            management
          </li>
          <li>1 routine item, minimum 1 task</li>
          <li>
            Task has to be created today. Tasks cannot be created for past days.
          </li>
          <li>
            Routine Items priority value is added to the kinetics of task action
            as, without action, the discipline reaps no benefit
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="points-system">Points System</h4>
        <p>
          If a routine item is less than 2 hours, a single task awards the
          complete point. If the routine item is more than 2 hours, the points
          are divided between multiple tasks.
        </p>
        <h3 id="geniuses">Geniuses</h3>
        <p>
          The geniuses sector is complex but the benefits are exponential. The
          points depend on your ability to PLAN and PERSEVERE. A day routine
          activity can be linked to week and further time intervals in cascading
          fashion. Hence points are divided between day, week, month, and year.
          If you accomplish a daily task that is a milestone to the week then
          you will gain 25% of the task completion for initiation of the
          milestone. Once you accomplish the same milestones for 5 days of the
          week, all 5 days will be contributed with the next 25% of points to
          all the week days you worked on. Furthermore, it will auto-check the
          week&#39;s goal. Similarly, 3 weeks would contribute to month and 9
          months to the year. Therefore the result is compounding points for
          every successful accomplishment. Although gaining points for this is
          hard initially, in long term, this point system will highly reward you
          in a snowball manner.
        </p>
        <h4 id="rules">Rules</h4>
        <p>
          There are four periods associated with Geniuses i.e. day, week, month,
          and year. The lifetime period acts as a reminder. The rules are as
          follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The top period are auto-completed once the threshold tasks of a
            period are completed
          </li>
          <li>
            Tasks are converted to the milestone by clicking the checkbox of
            &quot;Is Milestone&quot; during task creation
            <ul>
              <li>
                a day can only be linked to a week, a week to a month, and a
                month to a year. This is done to take strategic perioding
                planning to achieve the goal by using your intelligence.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>5 daily activity auto checks 1-week goal</li>
          <li>3 weeks goal of same month auto checks the 1-month goal</li>
          <li>9 months goal of same year auto checks 1-year goal</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="points-system">Points System</h4>
        <p>
          Points are distributed evenly between each period and compounded on
          accomplishment as pending days are auto-completed.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>day: 25%</li>
          <li>week: 25%</li>
